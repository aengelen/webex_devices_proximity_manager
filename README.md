# webex_devices_proximity_manager
Proximity manager when several devices are in the same room.

When you have more than one Webex device in the same room, ultrasound signals (used for Proximity pairing) from all devices can conflict. This script will allow you to define a master device and pick which device should emit ultrasound in the room (while turning off the other devices) from the master device Touch 10.
